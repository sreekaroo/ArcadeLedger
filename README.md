# ArcadeLedger

A simple Arcade Ledger application for keeping track of transactions, using Java and Java Swing. 

To use the application, download the JAR file double click to run. You may need to allow security preferences to open the file. I assure there is no malware. 
While using the application, when prompted to enter input, enter the number of tokens "space" description. 

3 features that would be useful:

1. A User authentication feature to allow for different users to use the same ledger system and keep track of their data. 
2. Given more data, expose the games offered at the arcade in the UI and directly spend tokens by clicking on that game. 
3. A wallet balance for the amount of dollar money you can spend on tokens.
